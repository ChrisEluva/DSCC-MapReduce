-Refreshed info on threads, etc. 
-Started repository
-got 9 text files
-outputted console to file, as was not sufficient to do it otherwise
-measured execution time for each method
-9 text files were not sufficient, so downloaded text more large text files from Project gutenburg
-used text compare to verify differences between files. 
-found bottleneck in threaded version, however then realised this method was never called for in the assignment
-verified output of each method, noting that the output of the threadsafe version was different than the threadpool version, however their length was the same,
meaning that they had the same output, but in a different order
